-- no firewalls
-- emergency
-- no network
-- congested network
-- Novel idea
-- Can be patented
-- Utility in a wide variety of scenarios




Motivation
-- Drones are getting sophisticated
    - size
    - capacity

-- Data storage devices are getting lighter and denser
    - 

Prototype Scheme

-- Building vicinity stations
-- A receptacle connected to computer
-- drone carries SSD
-- lands in such a way that the ssd endpoints plugs into the computer's usb plug triggering disk mount action
-- Disk mount will trigger a data dump operation
