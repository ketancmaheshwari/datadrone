Drone based data motion

Proposing a campus wide drone based data motion system.

A protocol that will decide upon the processes of:
- data delivery, 
- encryption, 
- compression etc.

Motivation
-- Drones are getting sophisticated
    - Range
    - Payload capacity
    - navigation
-- Data storage devices are getting lighter and denser

Back of the envelope Bandwidth calculations

    ORNL main-campus is 1.3 miles end-to-end.

Back of the envelope cost calculations

Benefits
-- out of band
-- no firewalls
-- emergency
-- no network, multi-day on-site experiments; data can be sent to processing facility and results can be had during the experiment steering it to beneficial direction.
-- congested network
-- Novel idea
-- Can be patented
-- Utility in a wide variety of scenarios, eg. while the network is under investigation for a suspected intrusion

A possible step-by-step scenario of a data transfer

step1. At source the user will move data to /drone dir on DTN
step2. User signals drone to start transfer
step3. Drone lifts-off and reaches the destination coordinates and lands
step4. Landing on the pod triggers a mount action on /drone at the destination DTN
step5. The user at destination moves data from /drone to their home area
step6. The user at destination signals the end of data transfer.
step7. Drone is ready for next data transfer.

Prototype Scheme

-- Building vicinity stations
-- A receptacle connected to computer
-- drone carries SSDs wrapped in weatherproof jackets
-- lands in such a way that the ssd endpoints plugs into the computer's usb plug triggering disk mount action
-- Disk mount will trigger a data dump operation

Contingencies

-- Rain could damage disks attached to drone 
-- Wind could cause drone to crash
-- Lightning could cause the drone pod to damage
